# FinalGameGap285

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

In my final project developed in Unreal Engine, I focused on creating a vertical slice of a third-person shooter, which significantly improved my understanding of the engine and game development processes. This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of Unreal's core systems, such as animation blueprints, AI behavior trees, and character movement, all of which were crucial for crafting responsive and immersive gameplay.

While working on the project, I faced challenges with balancing mechanics and optimizing performance, which ultimately helped me refine my problem-solving skills. I learned to manage time constraints effectively, debugging complex issues, and ensuring that the game flowed smoothly from a technical and player-experience standpoint.

Though I earned a B, the feedback I received highlighted key areas for improvement, such as polishing the user interface and enhancing level design. Reflecting on this, I now understand how to take my work to the next level by focusing on refining these aspects and pushing myself toward greater creativity and attention to detail.
